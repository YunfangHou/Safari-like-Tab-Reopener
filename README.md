# Safari-like-Tab-Reopener

\[ English | [简体中文](./README-zh.md) \]

This is a browser extension aimed to reproduce an intuitive Safari shortcut on other browsers, such as Firefox, Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge.

## Features

Safari-like function to reopen tab with `Command + Z`, or `Ctrl + Z` on Windows.

It will not conflict with the Undo function when you are in a text editing field, i.e., intelligently perform *Undo* instead of *Reopen Tab*.

Developed especially for the users who transfer from, and have got used to the intuitiveness of Safari. We also recommend all users experience this intuitive shortcut!

## Compatibility

Developed for all operation systems. Have been tested on macOS (Command + Z) and Windows (Ctrl + Z).

Developed for Firefox and all browsers using Chromium. Have been tested on Firefox, Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge.
